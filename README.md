In this analysis, three datasets related to electric vehicles (EVs) are explored. The first dataset provided detailed information about EVs, including their model year, range, base MSRP, and various geographic details. The second dataset focused on charging stations, offering insights into the infrastructure supporting EVs. Lastly, the third dataset included data about EVs, encompassing details such as model year, electric vehicle type, and legislative district. Our analysis began with a comprehensive segmentation strategy, encompassing geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral factors. We utilized Python, leveraging libraries like pandas, seaborn, and geopandas, to perform segmentation analysis, conduct visualizations, and build models. Our visualizations included geographic distribution maps of EVs and charging stations, segmentation analysis based on features like model year, and psychographic segmentation through pie charts depicting electric vehicle types. Additionally, we implemented machine learning techniques, such as KMeans clustering, to identify patterns in the data. This multifaceted approach provided valuable insights for an electric vehicle startup, aiding in strategic decisions for market entry, pricing, and understanding the diverse facets of the EV market in India.
